This project implements a Ternary Search Tree data structure for strings to 
implement an auto-complete functionality seen in many text-based applications.
It also compares the emperical running times of Ternary Search Trees, Balanced
Binary Search Trees, and Hash Tables to their expected analytical running times.
To compile the program run the command "make" in the directory of this project.
A separate git account was used during the creation of this project to keep it
private while in production.
